# ‚ö° DC-DC Boost Converter

**Course Project:** EE256  
**Under:** Dr. Vijay A. S.  
**Duration:** Mar 2024 ‚Äì Apr 2024  

A hardware and software implementation of a **DC-DC Boost Converter** designed as part of the EE256 course project.  
This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and analysis of a boost converter in both **hardware (breadboard prototype)** and **software (MATLAB Simulink)** domains.

## üìå Project Overview

The DC-DC Boost Converter is a type of **switch-mode power supply** that steps up (boosts) a lower input DC voltage to a higher output DC voltage.  
Our project involved:

- Implementing the boost converter on a breadboard.
- Designing and building a **Pulse Width Modulator (PWM)** using the TL494 IC.
- Simulating and analyzing the converter in **MATLAB Simulink**.
- Studying the converter behavior under **Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM)** and **Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM)**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Software Used

- **MATLAB Simulink** ‚Äì for converter modeling and waveform analysis  
- **LTSpice / Multisim (Optional)** ‚Äì for pre-verification of design parameters  
- **Digital Oscilloscope** ‚Äì for waveform observation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

The converter works in two phases:

1. **Switch ON:** Current flows through the inductor, storing energy in its magnetic field.  
2. **Switch OFF:** Inductor releases stored energy, boosting the voltage across the load.

The output voltage \( V_{out} \) is given by:

\[
V_{out} = \frac{V_{in}}{1 - D}
\]

Where **D** is the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

## üìä Results & Observations

- **Boosted Output:** Successfully stepped up input voltage (e.g., 5V ‚Üí ~9V at 60% duty cycle).  
- **Waveform Validation:** Observed expected current rise during switch ON and voltage boost during switch OFF.  
- **CCM vs DCM:** Verified theoretical predictions ‚Äî CCM showed continuous current flow, whereas DCM exhibited zero current intervals.

## üìà Future Improvements

- Replace TL494 with a microcontroller-based PWM generator (Arduino / STM32) for better flexibility.
- Improve efficiency using low-RDS(on) MOSFETs.
- Develop a PCB for a more robust and compact prototype.
